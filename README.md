# Java Web Parser #
This is an experimental Web Parser for cv.ee/en and jobsearch.az written in Java. 

Important Note: I wrote this program as a practice. It is incomplete and I don't recommend using this program for anything serious. 

## Installation ##

Download the items listed below:
- An IDE of your preference (IntelliJ is recommended)
- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) 
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html)
- [JSoup Library](https://jsoup.org/download)

After downloading all of these, add JDBC driver and JSoup library to the project structure. After this, program can be run.
